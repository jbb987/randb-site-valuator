        Well Finder ranks Texas oil &amp; gas wells by reactivation potential. Every well on the map
        carries a composite score blending production history, operator pressure, cost feasibility,
        and regulatory deadlines. Records refresh monthly so distress signals, deadlines, and orphan
        listings stay current.

        <dl className="space-y-3 text-sm">
          <Term term="Orphan well">
            A well whose operator's P-5 organization report has been delinquent (unrenewed) for more
            than 12 months. The "Orphan (N&nbsp;mo)" badge in the popup is the count of months the
            operator has been P-5 inactive — higher = deeper distress. Texas{' '}
            <strong>SB 1146</strong> (effective 2025) lets a reactivator take over an orphan well
            via <strong>Form P-4</strong> with limited liability, plus $0.50/foot State Managed
            Plugging reimbursement when restored to continuous service.
          </Term>
          <Term term="P-5 delinquent">
            All Texas operators must annually file <strong>Form P-5</strong> (Organization Report)
            to maintain their license. The "P-5 delinquent" badge means the operator was in
            delinquent status when this well's record was last generated. After 12+ months
            delinquent, the operator's wells land on the orphan list.
          </Term>
          <Term term="W-3X (Plugging Extension)">
            <strong>Statewide Rule 14</strong> requires inactive wells to be plugged within 12
            months.
            <strong> Form W-3X</strong> is the operator's request for an extension. Status codes:
            <span className="block mt-1 ml-3 text-[#7A756E]">
              <strong>A</strong> = active extension granted &nbsp;·&nbsp;
              <strong>D</strong> = denied (operator must plug or restore production) &nbsp;·&nbsp;
              <strong>P</strong> = pending review &nbsp;·&nbsp;
              <strong>blank</strong> = no extension on file
            </span>
            "W-3X D" is a strong forced-decision signal — the operator is on the plug clock.
          </Term>
          <Term term="Plug/reactivate by (SB 1150 deadline)">
            Texas <strong>SB 1150</strong> (effective Sept 1, 2027) requires that any well meeting{' '}
            <strong>both</strong> conditions — 25+ years old AND 15+ years inactive — be either
            plugged or returned to production. Per-well deadline = max(completion + 25 yrs, shut-in
            + 15 yrs, 2027-09-01). "in 16 mo" means the well crosses that threshold in 16 months;
            "12 mo past" means it already crossed it. The closer the deadline, the more motivated
            the current operator to either plug or sell — both create reactivation opportunities.
          </Term>
          <Term term="Cum oil / Cum gas">
            Lifetime cumulative production volume for the well, in barrels (oil) or thousand cubic
            feet (gas). Texas reports oil at lease level (multi-well leases share one production
            number); when allocation is approximated 1/N across wells on a lease, the popup flags it
            as "est."
          </Term>
          <Term term="Last 12-mo rate">
            Average daily production rate over the last 12 months of activity before the well went
            inactive (or current rate for active wells). Strongest single signal of reservoir
            performance at the moment of shut-in.
          </Term>
          <Term term="IP (Initial Production)">
            Average daily production rate over the first 6 months after the well came online. Proxy
            for completion quality and reservoir energy.
          </Term>
          <Term term="Total recoverable (Arps EUR)">
            Estimated Ultimate Recovery — the total volume (barrels or mcf) the well is forecast to
            produce over its remaining lifetime, computed by fitting an Arps hyperbolic decline
            curve to the well's monthly production history.{' '}
            <em>This is a volume, not a dollar value.</em> Bounded by economic limit assumptions;
            treat as a directional estimate, not a reserve report.
          </Term>
          <Term term="Plug cost estimate">
            State Managed Plugging Program (SMP) internal cost estimate for plugging this specific
            well, in dollars. Useful as both a cleanup-liability measure and a workover-cost proxy
            (similar depth + complexity).

            <strong>~1.4 million wells statewide</strong> — every active, inactive, shut-in, and
            plugged well in Texas, with operator, status, and coordinates.

            <strong>Inactive-well compliance</strong> — operator, P-5 number, lease, field, depth,
            shut-in date, months inactive, W-3X extension status, plug cost estimate, and compliance
            due date for every well that has been inactive 12+ months.

          <li>
            <strong>Orphan listings</strong> — operators with P-5 delinquent &gt;12 months, with
            months-delinquent counter for distress depth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Full production history since 1993</strong> — every monthly cycle for every
            Texas lease, used to compute cum oil/gas, IP, last 12-month rate, and Arps decline curve
            fits.

            <strong>Refresh cadence: monthly.</strong> Distress signals, orphan listings, and

        <p className="text-sm text-[#7A756E] mb-3">
          Use the rankings to build a short list — then verify on the ground before committing
          capital. The score does not capture:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-sm space-y-2 list-disc pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Per-well oil split on multi-well leases</strong>. Oil volumes are reported at
            lease level; allocation across wells on a shared lease is approximated 1/N (flagged
            "est." in the popup). Real per-well allocation requires test-data weighting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Water cut</strong>. Reactivation economics swing on water/oil ratio — verify via
            H-10 / W-10 injection records or the operator's last well files before budgeting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mechanical integrity</strong>. A high-scoring well still requires a casing /
            integrity test (H-15) before workover budgeting. Casing failure can turn a $50K
            reactivation into a $300K project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mineral lease status</strong>. Long-shut-in leases may have terminated under HBP
            (held-by-production) clauses; verify with county clerk records before signing anything.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reactivation cost</strong>. The plug cost shown is a directional proxy. Real
            workover budgeting depends on rod string condition, downhole equipment, and a field
            walkdown — none of which are captured in regulatory data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recent shut-ins.</strong> Production reporting settles slowly — wells that just
            shut in this month may not yet show that change. Always cross-check current status
            before contacting an operator.
