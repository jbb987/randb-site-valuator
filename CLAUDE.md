## Project Overview

Internal tool suite for R&B Power. The **CRM** is the central database (companies, contacts, documents). The **Site Analyzer** (formerly PIDDR / Infrastructure Report) is the analysis tool — input coordinates, run a multi-source analysis (power, broadband, water, gas, transport, valuation), export a PDF, and link the result to a CRM company.

### Tools

- **CRM** — Cross-cutting directory of Companies and Contacts, shared across Pre-Construction, Construction, and REP dimensions. Toggle between Companies and People, search, add/edit/delete. Fixed-enum tags (`REP` / `Construction` / `Pre Construction` / `Utility`) classify each company. Each company has a Documents section (PDFs + images) categorized as Legal / Invoices / Deliverables / Reports / Photos / Other, and a collapsible License Numbers section with free-text fields for the 5 tracked states (OK, TX, AZ, NM, TN). Mobile-first UI.
- **Site Analyzer** — Site analysis tool. Enter coordinates → runs land valuation, power, broadband, transport, water, gas, labor, and political radar analyses in parallel. Saves results to the site registry, optionally linked to a CRM company. PDF export. Three routes: index (`/site-analyzer`) lists all sites with search; new (`/site-analyzer/new`) is the entry form; detail (`/site-analyzer/:siteId`) is a tabbed view with one section visible at a time. **Per-section locks:** each lockable tab (Power, Broadband, Transport, Water, Gas, Labor, Political) has a lock icon. After a successful run a section auto-locks; "Re-analyze" then skips locked sections and only re-runs the unlocked ones. "Unlock all" clears every lock; the Re-analyze button is disabled when every section is locked. Stored as `sectionLocks` on `SiteRegistryEntry`. Political Radar ingest pipeline (federal layer): `refreshFederalBills` (daily, Congress.gov bills + joint resolutions filtered by threat keywords) and `refreshFederalOfficials` (weekly, all 535 current Congress members) Cloud Functions write to `political-radar-tracked-bills` and `political-radar-federal-officials` Firestore collections; the client reads from those collections — no Congress.gov API key in the browser bundle.
- **Grid Power Analyzer** — Interactive MapLibre GL map showing power generators, transmission lines, substations, and available capacity with heat map overlay. Coordinate search with gold diamond pin.
- **Labor Pool (Site Analyzer section only)** — County-anchored workforce data: population, labor force, unemployment, education, commute, industry mix, occupational wages, with state/national benchmarks. Live: FCC Area API (county FIPS, CORS-friendly), Census ACS 5yr (population/labor/education/commute), BLS QCEW (private-sector industries by NAICS supersector, county-level), BLS OEWS (occupations + hourly wage percentiles, state-level). MSA resolution requires a server-side proxy (Census Geocoder is CORS-blocked); `resolvedMsa` is null in the browser today. Optional `VITE_BLS_API_KEY` raises the BLS quota from 25 → 500 requests/day.
- **Leads (Sales CRM)** — Lead management for the sales team. Tracks leads through call/email outreach sequence (New → Call 1 → Email → Call 2 → Final Call → Won/Lost).
- **Sales Dashboard** — Admin-only aggregated view of sales performance. Leaderboard, pipeline breakdown, conversion rates.
- **Construction Projects** — Track active construction projects linked to CRM companies. Each project has overview, team (Owner/GC + subcontractors + supervisors + project managers + labor), tasks, photos, documents, and timeline. Permission levels derived from per-project membership: Admin (global) sees everything; a Supervisor sees and edits projects they're assigned to; Labor sees only assigned projects and can update their own task status + upload photos. Tool ID stays `construction-tracker`; collection stays `construction-jobs`.
- **User Management** — Admin-only tool to view, manage roles, and remove platform users.
- **Activity Log** — Admin-only audit trail at `/admin/activity`. Cloud Functions Firestore triggers (`onDocumentWrittenWithAuthContext`) on every top-level collection (`crm-companies`, `crm-contacts`, `crm-documents`, `sites-registry`, `construction-jobs`, `construction-jobs/*/tasks`, `leads`, `users`) plus a mirror trigger on `user-history` write activity entries to the `activity` collection. Each entry has actor (uid + email), action (create/update/delete/upload/tool-run/login/view/export), resource (type + id + label + optional parent), changedFields, before/after slice, optional client session fingerprint (`session: { ip, userAgent, timezone }` — present on client-driven login/view/tool-run/export entries), and a pre-rendered summary string. `login` entries fire from the client on every fresh sign-in; `view` entries fire on tool-page opens (via `Layout`) and on detail-page opens with the resource id+label (CRM company/contact, Site Analyzer site, Construction job). Page-view dedupe: 60s per (user, route). Session IP is fetched once per browser tab from `api.ipify.org` and cached in sessionStorage. The Admin Activity page surfaces a banner of suspicious patterns: multi-IP within 1 h, or active-without-fresh-sign-in for 7+ days. Idempotent on Functions v2 eventId. See `docs/activity-firestore-setup.md` for required Firestore rules and indexes.
- **Documents** — Internal document hub. Visible to every authenticated user; the cards on the page are filtered by `UserRole`. Each card opens a Google Drive URL in a new tab — no API or OAuth involved (Drive enforces access at click time; users can request access if denied). Shortcuts live in `src/lib/documents.ts` (`DOCUMENT_SHORTCUTS` array, role-gated). Today: My Documents (personal Drive) + Templates (shared folder). Add more shortcuts (HR, Legal, etc.) by appending to the array.
- **Well Finder** — Admin-only map of Texas oil & gas wells from the RRC. Identifies reactivation candidates (shut-in wells) and acquisition candidates (active wells). Status-colored points with toggleable filters. Production mode reads pre-tiled `wells.pmtiles` from Firebase Storage; dev fallback paginates the live RRC ArcGIS layer. Backend pipeline: monthly scheduled function (`fetchRrcWells`) → Storage trigger (`triggerPmtilesBuild`) → Cloud Run tippecanoe service → `wells.pmtiles`. See `functions/src/wellFinder/README.md`.

## Design System

### Colors

- **Brand red:** `#ED202B` (matches logo)
- **Brand dark:** `#9B0E18` (hover/pressed states)
- **Background:** `#FAFAF9` (near-white)
- **Text primary:** `#201F1E`
- **Text muted:** `#7A756E`
- **Border:** `#D8D5D0`

### Typography

- **Headings:** `Sora` (500, 600, 700) — via `font-heading` class, auto-applied to h1–h6
- **Body:** `IBM Plex Sans` (300, 400, 500, 600)

### Components

- **Cards:** `bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-[#D8D5D0]`
- **Primary buttons:** `bg-[#ED202B] text-white hover:bg-[#9B0E18]` (filled)
- **Secondary buttons:** `bg-white text-[#ED202B] border border-[#ED202B]` (outline)
- **Inputs focus:** `focus:border-[#ED202B] focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#ED202B]/20`
- **Icon containers:** `bg-[#ED202B]/10 rounded-lg` (tinted, no border)
- **Gray palette:** Use `stone-*` (warm-neutral) or brand hex values — never `slate-*`
- **Layout max-width:** `max-w-6xl` (Layout + Navbar must match)

## Versioning

- Version lives in `src/version.ts` as `APP_VERSION` (semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
- Displayed in the navbar next to the logo
- **Before pushing any branch**, bump the version in `src/version.ts`:
  - **PATCH** (`x.x.1` → `x.x.2`): bug fixes, small tweaks, styling changes
  - **MINOR** (`x.1.0` → `x.2.0`): new features, new tools, significant enhancements
  - **MAJOR** (`1.0.0` → `2.0.0`): breaking changes, major redesigns
- Default to a **PATCH** bump unless the change clearly warrants MINOR or MAJOR
- If the user specifies a bump level (e.g. "this is a minor bump"), use that instead

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Tool Architecture

- **CRM is the central database** — companies and contacts live in `crm-companies` and `crm-contacts`. The Site Analyzer's saved sites link to a company via `companyId` on `SiteRegistryEntry`.
- **Site Analyzer** owns writes to `sites-registry` (the analysis output cache).
- **Coordinates are the universal identifier** — sites are matched across tools by coordinates (parsed via `parseCoordinates` which supports decimal and DMS formats).
- **Company linkage** is set via the Site Analyzer's Company picker. Legacy `owner` field retained on pre-link sites for backward compatibility. The Company detail page surfaces all linked sites; clicking a site navigates to `/site-analyzer?siteId=X` which auto-loads the site in the Site Analyzer.
- **Coordinates-only input** — no address search. Coordinates field accepts decimal (`28.65, -98.84`) or DMS (`28°39'22.0"N 98°50'38.3"W`).
- **Backward-compat:** the previous ToolId `'piddr'` is normalized to `'site-analyzer'` on read in `useAuth` and `useUserHistory`. The Firestore field `piddrGeneratedAt` on `SiteRegistryEntry` is intentionally preserved (no migration).

### Site Analysis Generation

- `useSiteAnalysis` hook manages 7 parallel sections: Appraisal (instant), Infrastructure, Broadband, Transport, Water, Gas, Labor
- Each section has `AnalysisSectionState<T>` with `loading`, `error`, `data`
- `ExistingResults` allows skipping re-fetch for cached data from the registry
- Results are auto-saved to the site registry on completion
- PDF export via `usePdfExport` → `SiteAnalysisPdfDocument` (react-pdf with local fonts)

### Site Registry

- Sites stored in Firestore `sites-registry` collection as `SiteRegistryEntry`
- Each entry has an optional `projectId` field — **legacy** from the old folder system; preserved on documents but no UI reads it. Existing folders in the `projects` Firestore collection are also preserved as data; only the UI was removed.
- Sites are grouped by **company** instead (via `companyId`). The Company detail page lists all sites for a company; the Site Analyzer index lists all sites with a search.
- Write-back helpers: `saveAppraisalToSite`, `saveInfraToSite`, `saveBroadbandToSite`, `saveTransportToSite`, `saveWaterToSite`, `saveGasToSite`, `saveLaborToSite`, `saveAnalysisTimestamp`
- Dedup and migration utilities exist in `siteRegistry.ts` but are not auto-run

### Dashboard Organization

Tools are grouped into 5 sections that mirror R&B Power's three business lines (Pre-Construction, Construction, REP) plus cross-cutting Company tools and admin Settings. Section headers only render if the signed-in user has at least one visible tool inside.

1. **Company** — Directory, Documents _(cross-cutting)_
2. **Pre-Construction** — Site Analyzer, Grid Power Analyzer, Well Finder _(admin-only)_
3. **Construction** — Construction
4. **REP** — Leads, Sales Dashboard _(admin-only)_
5. **Settings** _(admin-only)_ — Activity Log, User Management

### Adding a New Tool/Page

When adding a new route, you MUST update these files:

1. **`src/App.tsx`** — Add the route inside `<Routes>`, wrapped in `<ProtectedRoute>`
2. **`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`** — Add the tool card to the appropriate section in `toolSections`
3. **`src/types/index.ts`** — Add the tool ID to `ToolId`, `ALL_TOOL_IDS`, and `TOOL_LABELS`

### Layout

All protected pages must be wrapped in `<Layout>` which provides:

- Sticky navbar
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Centered content container (`max-w-5xl`), or full-width via `fullWidth` prop

### Data Hierarchy

- **Companies** (CRM) own **Sites** (via `companyId` on `SiteRegistryEntry`)
- Sites can also be unlinked (no `companyId`) — visible on the Site Analyzer index only

### Auth & Roles

- Firebase auth via `useAuth` hook, which returns `{ user, role, loading, logout, allowedTools }`
- `role` is fetched from Firestore `users/{uid}` doc (`UserRole = 'admin' | 'employee'`)
- Users without a Firestore `users` doc are denied access
- Protected routes use `<ProtectedRoute>` with `toolId` or `allowedRoles` prop
- **Admin**: access to all tools
- **Employee**: access to tools listed in their `allowedTools` array

### Navigation Config

- `src/components/navbar/navConfig.ts` holds the `navLinks` array for navbar items

## Audit

A living audit document lives at **`AUDIT.md`** in the project root. Every agent working on this codebase must follow these rules:

- **Before fixing a bug or adding a feature**, check `AUDIT.md` for related open issues. If your work resolves one, update its status to `fixed` with the date and commit/PR reference.
- **If you discover a new security, quality, or performance issue** while working, add it to `AUDIT.md` under the appropriate severity section. Assign the next available ID (e.g. `M-14`).
- **If asked to run an audit**, review the codebase for new issues, verify that `fixed` items are actually resolved, and update `AUDIT.md` accordingly. Add a row to the Changelog table.
- **Never remove issues** — mark them `fixed` or `wontfix` with justification.
- Severity levels: **Critical** (security holes, data loss), **High** (reliability, performance), **Medium** (quality, maintainability), **Low** (style, minor improvements).

## Commands

```bash
npm install                         # Install dependencies
npm run dev                         # Start dev server
npm run build                       # Production build (tsc -b + vite build)
npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit  # Type-check the app (root tsconfig.json is a reference shell, plain `tsc --noEmit` checks nothing)
npx eslint --fix path/to/file.tsx   # Auto-fix lint issues on a single file
```

## Claude Code Hooks

Two hooks live in `.claude/settings.json`. Both are project-scoped (committed to git, apply to every Claude session in this repo).

### 1. `PreToolUse` — block edits on `main`

Script: `.claude/hooks/block-main-edit.sh`. Refuses Write/Edit when the current branch is `main`. Forces work onto a feature branch (Cloudflare Pages deploys from `main`, so direct commits there are deploys-by-accident).

If you (a human or Claude) hit this block: `git checkout -b feat/short-description` (or `chore/`, `fix/`) and retry.

### 2. `PostToolUse` — auto-format and type-check

Script: `.claude/hooks/post-edit-check.sh`. After every Write/Edit on a `.ts` or `.tsx` inside `src/`:

1. `prettier --write` on the file (silent)
2. `eslint --fix` on the file (silent)
3. `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` on the project — if it errors, the first 40 lines are fed back as `additionalContext` so the same Claude turn can fix the errors.

If the file is outside `src/` or not TypeScript, the hook exits silently.

**If you restructure `tsconfig` or move source out of `src/`,** update the hook script.

### Formatting (Prettier)

Config: `.prettierrc.json`. Ignore patterns: `.prettierignore`. Scripts:

- `npm run format` — format the whole repo
- `npm run format:check` — list files not formatted (CI-friendly; exits non-zero if drift found)

The PostToolUse hook formats edited files automatically — you rarely need to run these manually.

### Repo cleanup

Script: `.claude/scripts/cleanup.sh`, run via `npm run cleanup`. Idempotent. It:

- Fetches origin and prunes gone refs
- Removes worktrees whose branch is gone from origin
- Deletes local branches that are fully merged into `main` AND gone from origin

Safe by default — won't touch `main`/`dev`, won't force-delete unmerged branches. Run it before starting new work or weekly.
